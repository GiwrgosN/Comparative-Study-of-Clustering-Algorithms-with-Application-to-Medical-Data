# Comparative-Study-of-Clustering-Algorithms-with-Application-to-Medical-Data

In the context of this thesis 3 clustering algorithms are examined as well as their effectiveness with the 
use of medical data (patients with breast cancer). Purpose of applying these algorithms is the choice of 
the one with the best results as well as the answer to the question of whether they can be used to predict 
breast cancer.
 
Initially reference is made to the 3 different algorithms (K - means, Single Link, DBSCAN)
and to basic concepts such as how they function, correctness, various parameterization
techniques as well as time and space complexity. In addition, the advantages and
disadvantages of each one over the others are mentioned. In order to compare the above
methods, reference is made to evaluation indicators implemented using the R package
software.

Finally a graphical presentation of the data and application of the algorithms is followed
with the help of R package software.It should be noted that the process of improving the
performance of the algorithms is achieved both with the help of the aforementioned
techniques as well as with the testing and continuous execution of the respective software,
since the aim of this thesis was to compare the results under optimal parameterization
conditions.
